CT Seg
- as a postprocessing technique, will only keep a mask if it's larger
than some threshold.  To start, will only keep lesions in the mask if they
are larger than 9mm^3.
- both 9 and 27 are too small, and while results improve, they don't improve
drastically
- will try 125; ie: a 5x5x5 cube as the limit.
- 125 as a volume limit gives a much higher Dice: 0.58.
- maybe will try to optimize this number based on the train set...
- first will visually inspect results
- currently a bug regarding this limit: the resultant labels are not binary values
and thus the Dice coefficient is not correct.
- turning all labeled values back into binary values and recomputing.
- removing 9-voxel regions: 0.54
- removing 27-voxel regions: 0.552 Dice
- removing 125-voxel regions: 0.581 Dice
- removing 343-voxel regions: 0.613 Dice
- After inspecting the results, it is reasonable to say that an arbitrary 27-voxel region
removal is sufficient.
- signed rank test for significance
- box plot to show Dice scores; y-axis Dice, x-axis loc/data
- re-testing with NIH weights/NIH data and Multi Weights/NIH data to obtain slides for results
- using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the resultant dice values, we have
the following p-values:
    NIH to Multi: p = 0.009
    VU to Multi: p = 0.005
- in order to properly compare results, need to save specific slices
- these slices will be:
    10, 12, 14.
- Then we can display properly the comparisons
- TODO: 
    re-run testing on all sites with new "removing small FP" code
    get Wilcoxon test + box plot for all new results
    get image caps for relevant comparisons
    make slides for Landman meeting
    make slides for Prince meeting
    make slides for CNRM meeting



MISC
- Making mini tutorial showing how to continue training/ save json architectures

MODALITY SYNTH
- new dataset acquired, ensuring processing works
- need to enable multi-gpu training
- first trying with middle slices only to see if it works
- 2D images will need to be padded to 256 x 288 (originally 241, 286, 241)
- this allows for 5 downsample steps
